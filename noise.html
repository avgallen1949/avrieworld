            2025<br><br>
            A website exploring the hyperaesthetic through playful suspense. Hyperaesthetic engagement with the world is embodied by the devout conspiracy theorist or paranormal hunter. While most people dull out noise around us in our daily life, within this mindset all noise is potential signal to be analyzed, interpreted, and connected. My collaborator, <a href="https://brianeatswords.com/" target="_blank">Brian Dang</a>, took me on a ghost hunting endeavor, a "crypt kick," in which we earnestly sought out paranormal engagement. The documentation via photo stills and audio is presented on the website, and asks users to listen to the audio, review the images, and label them for potential anomalies.
