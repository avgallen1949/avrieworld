            Girlhood & its Aftermath is a magazine-inspired artist book featuring a compilation of written and verbal accounts of teenage girlhood. It is a collection of personal reflections on teenage adolescence by women and non-binary people. In reflecting on our experiences, both good and bad, and how they have shaped us, <em>Girlhood & its Aftermath</em> expands our collective understanding of how the personal is political. The work looks at the full range of teenage experience, utilizing personal writings and conversations, studies, feminist theory, and pop culture. <em>Girlhood & its Aftermath</em> is a testimony that teenage girlhood is a topic worthy of serious feminist consideration.</p>
